For this project I have decided to display what an Insertion Algorithm is and looks like. For the algorithm, I have decided to use Baseball as an example. I will take a handful of Teams and apply the 'insertion sorting algorithm' based off of the Teams' 2015 Estimated Payroll.

MLB 2015 Payroll Estimates gathered from: ['http://www.spotrac.com/mlb/payroll/']

CSS Stylesheet was gathered from Kickstart: ['http://www.99lime.com/elements/']
